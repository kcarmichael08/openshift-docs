{rh-rhacs-first} integrates with several vulnerability scanners to enable you to import your container images and watch them for vulnerabilities.

== Supported container image registries

Red Hat supports the following container image registries:

* Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
* Generic Docker registries (any generic Docker or Open Container Initiative-compliant image registries, for example, DockerHub, `gcr.io`, `mcr.microsoft.com`)
* Google Container Registry
* Google Artifact Registry
* IBM Cloud Container Registry
* JFrog Artifactory
* Microsoft Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Red Hat Quay
* Red Hat registry (`registry.redhat.io`, `registry.access.redhat.com`)
* Sonatype Nexus

This enhanced support gives you greater flexibility and choice in managing your container images in your preferred registry.

== Supported Scanners

You can set up {product-title-short} to obtain image vulnerability data from the following commercial container image vulnerability scanners:

* {product-title-short} Scanner v4: Beginning with release 4.4, a new scanner is introduced that is built on the {product-title-short} Stackrox and Clair scanners. The new scanner, Scanner v4, is the default scanner for language and OS-specific image components. You do not have to create an integration to use this scanner.
* StackRox Scanner: This scanner was the default scanner in {product-title-short} before the Scanner v4 was introduced in release 4.4. It originates from a fork of the Clair v2 open source scanner. You must continue using this scanner for RHCOS node scanning and for active vulnerability management until that functionality is supported using Scanner v4 in a future release.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Scanner v4 is the preferred image vulnerability scanner to use with {product-title-short}.
For more information about scanning container images with Scanner v4, see xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#scanning-images[Scanning images].

If you use one of these alternative scanners in your DevOps workflow, you can use the {product-title-short} portal to configure an integration with your vulnerability scanner. After the integration, the {product-title-short} portal shows the image vulnerabilities and you can triage them easily.
