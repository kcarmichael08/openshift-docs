You can configure {product-title-short} to send events to QRadar by configuring a generic webhook integration in {product-title-short}.

The following steps represent a high-level workflow for integrating {product-title-short} with QRadar:

. In {product-title-short}:
.. Configure the generic webhook.
.. Identify policies for which you want to send notifications, and update the notification settings for those policies. 
. If QRadar does not automatically detect the log source, add a {product-title-short} log source on the QRadar Console. See link:https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/dsm?topic=configuration-red-hat-advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes[Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes] for more information.

[NOTE]
====
When configuring the integration in {product-title-short}, in the *Endpoint* field, use the following example as a guide: `<URL to QRadar Box:<Port of Integration>`.
