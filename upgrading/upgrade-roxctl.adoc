[IMPORTANT]
====
* If you are using automatic upgrades:
** Update all your secured clusters by using automatic upgrades.
** Skip the instructions in this section and follow the instructions in the xref:../upgrading/upgrade-roxctl.adoc#verify-upgrades_{context}[Verify upgrades] and xref:../upgrading/upgrade-roxctl.adoc#revoke-the-api-token_{context}[Revoking the API token] sections.
* If you are not using automatic upgrades, you must run the instructions in this section on all secured clusters including the Central cluster.
** To ensure optimal functionality, use the same {product-title-short} version for your secured clusters and the cluster on which Central is installed.
====

To complete manual upgrades of each secured cluster running Sensor, Collector, and Admission controller, follow the instructions in this section.
