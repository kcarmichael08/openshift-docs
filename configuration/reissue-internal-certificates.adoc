[role="_abstract"]
Each component of {product-title} uses an X.509 certificate to authenticate itself to other components.
These certificates have expiration dates, and you must reissue them before they expire.
You can view the certificate expiry dates in the *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters* view from the RHACS portal.

== Reissuing internal certificates for Sensor, Collector, and Admission controller
Sensor, Collector, and Admission controller use certificates to communicate with each other, and with Central.

To replace the certificates, use one of the following methods:

* Create, download, and install an init bundle on the secured cluster. You must have the *Admin* user role to create an init bundle.
* Use the automatic upgrades functionality. Automatic upgrades are available only for static manifest deployments using the `roxctl` CLI.
