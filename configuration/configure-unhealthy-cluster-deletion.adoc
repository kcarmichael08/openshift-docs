[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} ({product-title-short}) provides the ability to automatically delete unhealthy clusters from your system. If this feature is enabled, when Central has been unable to reach Sensor in a cluster for a configured period of time, the cluster is considered unhealthy, or decommissioned. Unhealthy clusters are then automatically deleted based on your configuration settings. With automatic deletion of unhealthy clusters, you can monitor only active clusters. You can configure cluster removal settings by using the {product-title-short} portal or the application programming interface (API). You can specify not to delete an unhealthy cluster by adding a label for the cluster when configuring this feature.

Automatic removal of unhealthy clusters is disabled by default. To enable this setting, enter a nonzero number in the *Decommissioned cluster age* field, as described in the following procedure. The *Decommissioned cluster age* field indicates the number of days that a cluster can remain unreachable before it is considered unhealthy. When a cluster is unhealthy, the *Clusters* page displays the status of the cluster and the number of days after which the cluster will be deleted if it continues to remain unhealthy. After a cluster is deleted, the deletion is documented with an `info` log in the Central logs.

[NOTE]
====
There is a 24-hour grace period after enabling this setting before clusters are deleted. The cluster that hosts Central is never deleted.
