= Data access and permissions


[role="_abstract"]
Red Hat does not have access to the clusters on which you install the secured cluster services.
Also, {product-title-managed-short} does not need permission to access the secured clusters.
For example, you do not need to create new IAM policies, access roles, or API tokens.

However, {product-title-managed-short} stores the data that secured cluster services send.
All data is encrypted within {product-title-managed-short}.
Encrypting the data within the {product-title-managed-short} platform helps to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.

When you install secured cluster services on a cluster, it generates data and transmits it to the {product-title-managed-short}.
This data is kept secure within the {product-title-managed-short} platform, and only authorized SRE team members and systems can access this data.
{product-title-managed-short} uses this data to monitor the security and compliance of your cluster and applications, and to provide valuable insights and analytics that can help you optimize your deployments.
