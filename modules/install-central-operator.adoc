= Installing Central

[role="_abstract"]
The main component of {product-title} is called Central. You can install Central on {ocp} by using the `Central` custom resource. You deploy Central only once, and you can monitor multiple separate clusters by using the same Central installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you install {product-title} for the first time, you must first install the `Central` custom resource because the `SecuredCluster` custom resource installation is dependent on certificates that Central generates.
====

.Prerequisites
* You must be using {ocp} 4.6 or later.

.Procedure
. On the {ocp} web console, navigate to the *Operators* -> *Installed Operators* page.
. Select the {product-title} Operator from the list of installed Operators.
. If you have installed the Operator in the recommended namespace, {ocp} lists the project as `rhacs-operator`. Select *Project: rhacs-operator* -> *Create project*.
+
[WARNING]
====
* If you have installed the Operator in a different namespace, {ocp} shows the name of that namespace rather than `rhacs-operator`.
* You must install the {product-title} `Central` custom resource in its own project and not in the `rhacs-operator` and `openshift-operator` projects, or in the project in which you have installed the {product-title} Operator.
====
. Enter the new project name (for example, `stackrox`), and click *Create*. Red Hat recommends that you use `stackrox` as the project name.
. Under the *Provided APIs* section, select *Central*. Click *Create Central*.
. Enter a name for your `Central` custom resource and add any labels you want to apply. Otherwise, accept the default values for the available options.
//Add a link for customization options
. Click *Create*.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using the cluster-wide proxy, {product-title} uses that proxy configuration to connect to the external services.
====
.Next Steps
. Verify Central installation.
. Optional: Configure Central options.
. Generate an init bundle.
