* Run the following command to check the build-time and deploy-time violations of your security policies in YAML deployment files:
//TODO: Add link to security policies section
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ roxctl deployment check --file=_<yaml_filename>_
----
+
The format is defined in the API reference.
To cause {rh-rhacs-first} to re-pull image metadata and image scan results from the associated registry and scanner, add the `--force` option.
+
[NOTE]
====
To check specific image scan results, you must have a token with both `read` and `write` permissions for the `Image` resource.
The default *Continuous Integration* system role already has the required permissions.
//TODO: Add link to the system role topic.

This command validates the following items:

** Configuration options in a YAML file, such as resource limits or privilege options
** Aspects of the images used in a YAML file, such as components or vulnerabilities
