= Automatic Configuration

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} includes default integrations with standard registries, such as Docker Hub and others. It can also automatically configure integrations based on artifacts found in the monitored clusters, such as image pull secrets. Usually, you do not need to configure registry integrations manually.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are using a GCR registry, {product-title} does not create a registry integration automatically.

[id="amazon_ecr_{context}"]
= Amazon ECR integrations

For Amazon ECR integrations, {product-title} automatically generates ECR registry integrations if the following conditions are met:

* The cloud provider for the cluster is AWS.
* The nodes in your cluster have an Instance Identity and Access Management (IAM) Role association and the Instance Metadata Service is available in the nodes. For example, when using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to manage your cluster, this role is known as the EKS Node IAM role.
* The Instance IAM role has IAM policies granting access to the ECR registries from which you are deploying.

If the listed conditions are met, {product-title} monitors deployments that pull from ECR registries and automatically generates ECR integrations for them. You can edit these integrations after they are automatically generated.
