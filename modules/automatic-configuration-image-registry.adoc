= Automatic Configuration

[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} includes default integrations with standard registries, such as
Docker Hub and others.  In addition, it can also automatically configure
integrations based on artifacts found in the monitored clusters, such as image
pull secrets.  Usually, you do not need to configure registry integrations
manually.

In the case of AWS ECR, {product-title} will automatically create ECR registry
integrations if the following conditions are met:

. The cluster's cloud provider is AWS.
. The nodes in your cluster have an Instance IAM Role association and the
  Instance Metadata Service is available in the nodes.  For example, when using
  AWS EKS to manage your cluster, this role is known as the EKS Node IAM role.
. The Instance IAM role has IAM policies granting access to the ECR registries
  you are deploying from.

If the above conditions are met, {product-title} will monitor deployments that
are pulling from ECR registries and will auto-generate an ECR integrations for
them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you use registries like GCR, {product-title} does not create a registry
integration automatically.
