= Upgrading by using the Operator


[role="_abstract"]
Upgrades through the {rh-rhacs-first} Operator are performed automatically or manually, depending on the *Update approval* option you chose at installation. However, automatic upgrade is prevented for {product-title-short} version 4.0 from version 3.74.

To prevent automatic upgrades when using the Operator, {product-title-short} 4.0 uses a new subscription channel. This update allows the {product-title-short} Operator to comply with Red Hat standards and provides consistency with other Red Hat Operators. You must explicitly change your subscription channel when upgrading. Customers who remain on the `latest` channel in the current {product-title-short} Operator channel will continue to receive 3.74 updates until it is no longer supported.

The upgrade process includes automatically migrating the database, and requires no intervention.

After Central is upgraded, upgrade the subscription channel on all Secured Clusters to `stable`.

You are encouraged to evaluate the upgrade in a staging environment before pushing it to production to ensure that your unique environment does not present unforeseen issues.
