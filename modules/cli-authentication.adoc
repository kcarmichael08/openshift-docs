= Exporting and saving the API token

//TODO: Add links to role based access control

.Procedure

. After you have generated the authentication token, export it as the `ROX_API_TOKEN` variable by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ export ROX_API_TOKEN=<api_token>
----
. (Optional): You can also save the token in a file and use it with the `--token-file` option by entering the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ roxctl central debug dump --token-file <token_file>
----

Note the following guidelines:

* You cannot use both the `-password` (`-p`) and the `--token-file` options simultaneously.
* If you have already set the `ROX_API_TOKEN` variable, and specify the `--token-file` option, the `roxctl` CLI uses the specified token file for authentication.
* If you have already set the `ROX_API_TOKEN` variable, and specify the `--password` option, the `roxctl` CLI uses the specified password for authentication.
