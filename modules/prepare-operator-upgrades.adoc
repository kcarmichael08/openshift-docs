[role="_abstract"]
Before you upgrade the {rh-rhacs-first} version, you must perform the following steps:

* Verify that you are running the latest patch release version of the {product-title-short} Operator 3.74.
* Backup your existing Central database.
* If the `SecuredCluster` custom resource is present in the cluster, ensure the per node collection setting is set to EBPF by following these steps:
. In the {ocp} web console, navigate to the {rh-rhacs-first} Operator page.
. Select *Secured Cluster* in the top navigation bar, and then select the instance by clicking on the name (for example, *stackrox-secured-cluster-services*).
. Click *YAML* to open the YAML editor view.
. Locate the `spec.perNode.collector.collection` attribute.
. If the value of this attribute is `KernelModule`, change it to `EBPF`.
. Click `Save`.
