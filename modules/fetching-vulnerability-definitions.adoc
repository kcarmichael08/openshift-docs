= Fetching vulnerability definitions

//verify this info is still accurate
In online mode, Central fetches the vulnerability definitions every 5 minutes from a single feed.
This feed combines vulnerability definitions from upstream sources that include multiple Linux distributions, the National Vulnerability Database, and other sources, and it refreshes every hour.

* The address of the feed is `\https://definitions.stackrox.io`.
* You can change the default query frequency for Central by setting the `ROX_SCANNER_VULN_UPDATE_INTERVAL` environment variable:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n stackrox set env deploy/central ROX_SCANNER_VULN_UPDATE_INTERVAL=<value> <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.

[NOTE]
====
Scanner's configuration map still has an `updater.interval` parameter for configuring Scanner's updating frequency, but it no longer includes the `fetchFromCentral` parameter.
