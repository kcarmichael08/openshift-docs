= {product-title} architecture overview

{product-title} ({product-title-short}) uses a distributed architecture that supports high-scale deployments and is optimized to minimize the impact on the underlying {ocp} or Kubernetes nodes.

[NOTE]
====
The architecture is slightly different when you install {product-title-short} on Kubernetes and in {ocp}.
However, the underlying components and the interactions between them remain the same.

The following graphic shows the architecture with the Stackrox Scanner, the default scanner for version 4.3 and earlier.

You install {product-title-short} as a set of containers in your {ocp} or Kubernetes cluster. {product-title-short} includes:

* Central services you install on one cluster
* Secured cluster services you install on each cluster you want to secure by {product-title-short}

In addition to these primary services, {product-title-short} also interacts with other external components to enhance your clusters' security.
