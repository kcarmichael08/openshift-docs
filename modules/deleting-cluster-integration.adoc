= Deleting cluster integration

.Procedure

* Before deleting the cluster, ensure you have the correct cluster name that you want to remove from Central:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ roxctl cluster delete --name=_<cluster_name>_
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Deleting the cluster integration does not remove the {product-title-short} services running in the cluster, depending on the installation method.
You can remove the services by running the `delete-sensor.sh` script from the Sensor installation bundle.
