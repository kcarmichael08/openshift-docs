= Installing Sensor by using the sensor.sh script

When you generate the Sensor deployment files, `roxctl` creates a directory called `sensor-<cluster_name>` in your working directory. The script to install Sensor is located in this directory.

.Procedure

* Run the sensor installation script to install Sensor:
+
[source,terminal,subs="+quotes"]
----
$ ./sensor-_<cluster_name>_/sensor.sh
----
+
If you get a warning that you do not have the required permissions to install Sensor, follow the on-screen instructions, or contact your cluster administrator for help.
