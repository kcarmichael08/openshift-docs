Vulnerability reporting in Vulnerability Management 2.0 provides the ability to create and download an on-demand image vulnerability report. This report includes detected Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) across images and deployments, known as workload CVEs. You can share this report with auditors or internal stakeholders by scheduling emails in {product-title-short} or by downloading the report and sharing it by using other methods.
