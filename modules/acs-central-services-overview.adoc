= Central services

You install Central services on a single cluster.
These services include three main components, Central, Central DB and Scanner.

* *Central*: Central is the {product-title-short} application management interface and services.
It handles API interactions and user interface ({product-title-short} Portal) access.
You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple {ocp} or Kubernetes clusters.
* *Central DB*: Central DB is the database for {product-title-short} and handles all data persistence. It is currently based on PostgreSQL 13.
* *Scanner*: Scanner is a Red Hat-developed and certified vulnerability scanner for scanning container images. Scanner performs the following functions:

** It analyzes all image layers and checks for known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the vulnerability database that contains information from various sources.
** It identifies vulnerabilities in installed packages and dependencies for multiple programming languages.
In addition to scanning container images, Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in the node's operating system and orchestrators.
For example, it scans nodes to identify Kubernetes, {ocp}, and Istio vulnerabilities.
