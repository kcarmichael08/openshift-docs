= Central services

You install Central services on a single cluster.
These services include four main components, Central, Central DB, Stackrox Scanner, and Scanner V4 (optional).

* *Central*: Central is the {product-title-short} application management interface and services.
It handles API interactions and user interface ({product-title-short} Portal) access.
You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple {ocp} or Kubernetes clusters.
* *Central DB*: Central DB is the database for {product-title-short} and handles all data persistence. It is currently based on PostgreSQL 13.
* *Scanners*: Beginning with release 4.4, {product-title-short} provides two Red Hat-developed and certified vulnerability scanners for scanning container images. Scanner V4, which was developed by consolidating the Stackrox and Clair scanners, is the default scanner for language and OS-specific image components. The Stackrox Scanner was the default scanner in product-title-short before Scanner V4 was introduced in release 4.4. The Stackrox Scanner originates from a fork of the Clair v2 open source scanner. You must continue using this scanner for RHCOS node scanning and for active vulnerability management until that functionality is supported using Scanner V4 in a future release. The scanners perform the following functions:

** They analyze all image layers and checks for known vulnerabilities from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) list.
** They identify vulnerabilities in installed packages and dependencies for multiple programming languages.
In addition to scanning container images, the Stackrox Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in the node's operating system and orchestrators.
For example, it scans nodes to identify Kubernetes, {ocp}, and Istio vulnerabilities.
