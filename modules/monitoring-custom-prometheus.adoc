= Monitoring with custom Prometheus

link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] is an open-source monitoring and alerting platform.
You can use it to monitor health and availability of Central and Sensor components of {product-title-short}. When you enable monitoring, {product-title-short} creates a new monitoring service on port number 9090 and a network policy allowing inbound connections to that port.

[NOTE]
====
This monitoring service exposes an endpoint that is not encrypted by TLS and has no authorization.
Use this only when you do not want to use {osp} monitoring.
====

Before you can use custom Prometheus monitoring, if you have {osp}, you must disable the default monitoring. If you are using Kubernetes, you do not need to perform this step.
