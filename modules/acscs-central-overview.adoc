= Central

Red Hat manages Central, the control plane for {product-title-managed-short}.
It includes three main components: Central, Central DB, and Scanner.

* *Central*: Central is the application management interface and services for {product-title-managed-short}.
It manages API interactions and user interface access.
You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple {ocp} or Kubernetes clusters.
* *Central DB*: Central DB is the database for {product-title-managed-short} and handles all data persistence.
It is currently based on PostgreSQL 13.
* *Scanner*: Scanner is a Red Hat-developed and certified vulnerability scanner for scanning container images.
Scanner performs the following functions:

** It analyzes all image layers and checks for known vulnerabilities from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) list.
** It identifies vulnerabilities in installed packages and dependencies for multiple programming languages.
In addition to scanning container images, Scanner also identifies vulnerabilities in the node's operating system and orchestrators.
For example, it scans nodes to identify vulnerabilities in Kubernetes, {ocp}, and Istio.
