= Integrating the StackRox Scanner with Clair

Beginning with release 4.4, Clair scanning features are available in the new {product-title-first} scanner, Scanner v4, and do not require a separate integration. The instructions in this section are only required if you are using the StackRox Scanner.

[NOTE]
====
* With {product-title-short} 3.74, a separate integration was required to use the Clair V4 Scanner. This integration is no longer required if you are using Scanner v4 with {product-title-short} release 4.4 and later.
* There is no planned support for the link:https://quay.github.io/clair/concepts/authentication.html[JWT-based authentication] option for Clair V4 integration in the next {product-title-short} 4.0 release.
