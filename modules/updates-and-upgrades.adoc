= Updates and Upgrades

Red Hat makes a commercially reasonable effort to notify customers prior to updates and upgrades that impact service.
The decision regarding the need for a Service update to the Central instance and its timing is the sole responsibility of Red Hat.

Customers have no control over when a Central service update occurs. For more information, see link:https://www.redhat.com/licenses/Appendix_4_Red_Hat_Online_Services_20221213.pdf[PRODUCT APPENDIX 4 RED HAT ONLINE SERVICES].
Upgrades to the version of {rh-rhacscs-first} are considered part of the service update.

To ensure optimal functionality and compatibility between Central and secured clusters, upgrade your secured clusters to the latest software version available. (The software version for Central is automatically updated.)
