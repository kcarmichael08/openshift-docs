= Enhancing image scanning by accessing delegated image scanning

Currently, by default, Central Services Scanner performs both indexing (identification of components) and vulnerability matching (enrichment of components with vulnerability data) for images observed in your secured clusters, with the exception of images from the {ocp} integrated registry.

For images from the {ocp} integrated registry, Scanner-slim installed in your secured cluster performs the indexing, and the Central Services Scanner performs the vulnerability matching.

The delegated image scanning feature extends scanning functionality by allowing Scanner-slim to index images from any registry and then send them to Central for vulnerability matching. To use this feature, ensure that  Scanner-slim is installed in your secured clusters. If Scanner-slim is not present, scan requests are sent directly to Central.
