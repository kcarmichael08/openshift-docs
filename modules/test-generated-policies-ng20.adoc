= Testing generated policies in the network graph

After you download the network policies that {product-title-short} generates, you can test them by applying them to your cluster by using the CLI or your automated deployment procedures. You cannot apply generated network policies directly in the network graph.

.Procedure
. To create policies using the saved YAML file, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f "<generated_file>.yml" <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.
. If the generated policies cause problems, you can remove them by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc delete -f "<generated_file>.yml" <1>
----
<1> If you use Kubernetes, enter `kubectl` instead of `oc`.

[WARNING]
====
Directly applying network policies might cause problems for running applications.
Always download and test the network policies in a development environment or test clusters before applying them to production workloads.
