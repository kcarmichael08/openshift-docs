= {product-title-managed} architecture overview

{rh-rhacscs-first} is a Red Hat managed Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform that lets you protect your Kubernetes and {ocp} clusters and applications throughout the build, deploy, and runtime lifecycles.

{product-title-managed-short} includes many built-in DevOps enforcement controls and security-focused best practices based on industry standards such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks and the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST) guidelines.
You can also integrate it with your existing DevOps tools and workflows to improve security and compliance.

Central services include the user interface (UI), data storage, {product-title-short} application programming interface (API), and image scanning capabilities.
You deploy your Central service through the link:https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.] When you create a new ACS instance, Red Hat creates your individual control plane for {product-title-short}.

{product-title-managed-short} allows you to secure self-managed clusters that communicate with a Central instance.
The clusters you secure, called Secured Clusters, are managed by you, and not by Red Hat.
Secured Cluster services include optional vulnerability scanning services, admission control services, and data collection services used for runtime monitoring and compliance.
You install Secured Cluster services on any OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster you want to secure.
